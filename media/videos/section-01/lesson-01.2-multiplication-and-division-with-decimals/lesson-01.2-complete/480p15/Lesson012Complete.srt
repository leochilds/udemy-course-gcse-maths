00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,114
Welcome to this lesson on multiplication and division

2
00:00:03,214 --> 00:00:05,843
with decimals. In this session, we will learn

3
00:00:05,943 --> 00:00:08,572
how to multiply two decimal numbers together.

4
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:11,319
We will also look at how to divide by a

5
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:16,612
decimal number by transforming the calculation into one involving integers.

6
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:19,660
We'll start by reviewing some key terms:

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,522
the decimal point and decimal places.

8
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,741
The number system is extended by using decimal

9
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:31,300
numbers to represent fractions. The decimal point separates

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,135
the whole-number part from the fractional part.

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,107
Take the number twenty-five point three seven four, for example. To the

12
00:00:39,207 --> 00:00:43,268
left of the decimal point, we have two Tens and five Units.

13
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,292
To the right, we have three

14
00:00:45,392 --> 00:00:48,875
Tenths, seven Hundredths, and four Thousandths.

15
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:53,328
We use this every day with money. Thirty-six pounds

16
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:58,705
sixty-seven is simply three tens, six units, six tenths—which

17
00:00:58,805 --> 00:01:03,905
are ten pence coins—and seven hundredths—which are pennies.

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,760
When we talk about 'decimal places,' we are referring to the

19
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,008
positions of the digits to the right of the decimal point.

20
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,017
For instance, seventy-nine point four has one digit after

21
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,765
the point, so it has one decimal place.

22
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:22,774
Six point eight three has two digits after

23
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:26,622
the point, so it has two decimal places.

24
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,853
And zero point five two six has three decimal places. Knowing this

25
00:01:30,953 --> 00:01:35,429
is crucial for rounding and for checking our answers in multiplication.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,632
Often, you will need to round a decimal

27
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,855
number to a specific number of decimal places.

28
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:46,223
Here is the method: Start at the decimal point and count

29
00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:49,673
along to the required number of places. Then, look at the

30
00:01:49,773 --> 00:01:52,942
very next digit—the first one you are going to remove.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,275
If that digit is less than five, you

32
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:58,046
simply remove it and all following digits.

33
00:01:58,133 --> 00:02:02,460
If that digit is five or more, you must round up. Add one to

34
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,142
the digit in the previous decimal place, and then remove the unwanted digits.

35
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,903
Let's practice this with some examples. First, round five

36
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:17,149
point eight five two to two decimal places.

37
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:22,018
The second decimal digit is five. The next digit is two, which is

38
00:02:22,118 --> 00:02:26,302
less than five. So, we leave it as five point eight five.

39
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:31,752
Second, round seven point one five six to two decimal places.

40
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:35,703
The second digit is five, but the next digit is six.

41
00:02:35,803 --> 00:02:39,292
Since six is five or more, we round up the five

42
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:42,652
to a six. The answer is seven point one six.

43
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,432
Third, round zero point two seven four to one decimal place.

44
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,374
The first digit is two. The next is seven, which is high

45
00:02:51,474 --> 00:02:55,915
enough to round up. So, zero point two becomes zero point three.

46
00:02:55,966 --> 00:03:00,452
Finally, fifteen point three five one eight to one decimal place.

47
00:03:00,552 --> 00:03:03,838
The next digit is five, so we round up the three

48
00:03:03,938 --> 00:03:06,942
to a four. The result is fifteen point four.

49
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:12,972
Now, let's look at multiplying two decimal numbers. The easiest way

50
00:03:13,072 --> 00:03:17,105
to do this is to temporarily forget about the decimal points.

51
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,788
First, multiply each decimal by a power of ten—like ten,

52
00:03:21,888 --> 00:03:26,895
one hundred, or one thousand—to turn them into whole numbers.

53
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:30,699
Second, multiply those whole numbers together.

54
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:35,465
Third, multiply the powers of ten you used in step one.

55
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:40,272
Finally, divide your result by that combined power of ten

56
00:03:40,372 --> 00:03:44,602
to put the decimal point back in the correct place.

57
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:50,899
Let's calculate three point four two multiplied by two point seven.

58
00:03:50,966 --> 00:03:53,959
First, we make them whole numbers. Three point four

59
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:56,688
two has two decimal places, so we multiply by

60
00:03:56,788 --> 00:03:59,539
one hundred to get three hundred and forty-two.

61
00:03:59,633 --> 00:04:02,585
Two point seven has one decimal place, so

62
00:04:02,685 --> 00:04:05,489
we multiply by ten to get twenty-seven.

63
00:04:05,566 --> 00:04:08,311
Now we calculate three hundred and forty-two

64
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:11,737
times twenty-seven. Using long multiplication, we get

65
00:04:11,837 --> 00:04:14,452
nine thousand two hundred and thirty-four.

66
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,811
We multiplied by one hundred and then by

67
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:21,479
ten. One hundred times ten is one thousand.

68
00:04:21,566 --> 00:04:24,860
So, we must divide our answer, nine thousand two

69
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,818
hundred and thirty-four, by one thousand. This moves the

70
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:31,576
decimal point three places to the left.

71
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:35,895
The final answer is nine point two three four.

72
00:04:37,466 --> 00:04:41,768
Dividing by a decimal number can be tricky. The best strategy is to

73
00:04:41,868 --> 00:04:46,039
change the problem so you are dividing by a whole number instead.

74
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:51,781
Look at the divisor—the number you are dividing by. Decide what you

75
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:55,985
need to multiply it by to make it a whole number.

76
00:04:56,066 --> 00:05:00,368
Then, multiply BOTH parts of the division by that same amount. This

77
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:04,639
keeps the answer the same, but makes the calculation much easier.

78
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:10,495
Let's try forty-two divided by zero point two.

79
00:05:10,566 --> 00:05:17,545
First, let's write this as a fraction. Forty-two over zero point two.

80
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:22,190
To make the denominator a whole number, we multiply by ten

81
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:27,329
over ten. This effectively multiplies the top and bottom by ten.

82
00:05:27,366 --> 00:05:29,840
Note that ten over ten is just one. So

83
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,836
unlike multiplication, we aren't changing the value, and we

84
00:05:33,936 --> 00:05:36,749
won't need to adjust the answer at the end.

85
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:40,742
Forty-two times ten is four hundred and twenty.

86
00:05:40,842 --> 00:05:43,812
And zero point two times ten is two.

87
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,592
Because the powers of ten cancel out, four hundred and twenty divided

88
00:05:48,692 --> 00:05:52,968
by two gives us the final answer directly: two hundred and ten.

89
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:57,411
Now a harder one: nineteen point eight

90
00:05:57,511 --> 00:05:59,919
divided by zero point five five.

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,215
The divisor is zero point five five. To make this

92
00:06:03,315 --> 00:06:06,665
a whole number, we need to multiply by one hundred.

93
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,863
So we multiply nineteen point eight by one hundred as

94
00:06:09,963 --> 00:06:13,399
well, which gives us one thousand nine hundred and eighty.

95
00:06:13,466 --> 00:06:17,742
Our new problem is one thousand nine hundred and eighty divided

96
00:06:17,842 --> 00:06:22,535
by fifty-five. We can use long division or repeated subtraction here.

97
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,857
Twenty times fifty-five is one thousand one hundred.

98
00:06:25,957 --> 00:06:29,150
Subtracting that from one thousand nine hundred and

99
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,668
eighty leaves eight hundred and eighty.

100
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:35,032
Two times fifty-five is one hundred and ten. Eight

101
00:06:35,132 --> 00:06:38,160
times one hundred and ten is eight hundred and

102
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,899
eighty. This corresponds to sixteen lots of fifty-five.

103
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:46,845
Twenty plus sixteen equals thirty-six. So, nineteen point eight

104
00:06:46,945 --> 00:06:50,505
divided by zero point five five is thirty-six.

105
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,809
To summarize, we've seen that decimals are

106
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:57,485
just another way to represent fractions.

107
00:06:57,566 --> 00:07:00,758
When rounding, always look at the digit immediately

108
00:07:00,858 --> 00:07:02,952
to the right of your target place.

109
00:07:03,033 --> 00:07:06,953
For multiplication, treat them as whole numbers first, then

110
00:07:07,053 --> 00:07:09,542
put the decimal point back at the end.

111
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:12,826
And for division, always adjust the problem so

112
00:07:12,926 --> 00:07:15,332
you are dividing by a whole number.

113
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:17,487
With these methods, you can handle

114
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:20,099
any decimal calculation with confidence.
