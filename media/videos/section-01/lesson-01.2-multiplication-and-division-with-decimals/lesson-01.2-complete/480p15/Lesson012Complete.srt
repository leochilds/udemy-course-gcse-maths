00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,114
Welcome to this lesson on multiplication and division

2
00:00:03,214 --> 00:00:05,843
with decimals. In this session, we will learn

3
00:00:05,943 --> 00:00:08,572
how to multiply two decimal numbers together.

4
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:11,319
We will also look at how to divide by a

5
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:16,612
decimal number by transforming the calculation into one involving integers.

6
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:19,660
We'll start by reviewing some key terms:

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,522
the decimal point and decimal places.

8
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,741
The number system is extended by using decimal

9
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:31,300
numbers to represent fractions. The decimal point separates

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,135
the whole-number part from the fractional part.

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,168
Take the number 25.374, for example. To the left of

12
00:00:39,268 --> 00:00:43,739
the decimal point, we have 2 Tens and 5 Units.

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,779
To the right, we have 3 Tenths, 7 Hundredths, and 4 Thousandths.

14
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:55,969
We use this every day with money. £36.67 is simply 3 tens,

15
00:00:56,069 --> 00:01:02,965
6 units, 6 tenths—which are 10 pence coins—and 7 hundredths—which are pennies.

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,760
When we talk about 'decimal places,' we are referring to the

17
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,008
positions of the digits to the right of the decimal point.

18
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,861
For instance, 79.4 has one digit after the

19
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:18,079
point, so it has one decimal place.

20
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:24,832
6.83 has two digits after the point, so it has two decimal places.

21
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,177
And 0.526 has three decimal places. Knowing this is crucial

22
00:01:29,277 --> 00:01:33,629
for rounding and for checking our answers in multiplication.

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,832
Often, you will need to round a decimal

24
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:41,055
number to a specific number of decimal places.

25
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:44,423
Here is the method: Start at the decimal point and count

26
00:01:44,523 --> 00:01:47,873
along to the required number of places. Then, look at the

27
00:01:47,973 --> 00:01:51,142
very next digit—the first one you are going to remove.

28
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,651
If that digit is less than 5, you

29
00:01:53,751 --> 00:01:56,899
simply remove it and all following digits.

30
00:01:56,933 --> 00:02:00,512
If that digit is 5 or more, you must round up. Add 1 to

31
00:02:00,612 --> 00:02:05,662
the digit in the previous decimal place, and then remove the unwanted digits.

32
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:11,400
Let's practice this with some examples. First,

33
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,369
round 5.852 to 2 decimal places.

34
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:19,483
The second decimal digit is 5. The next digit is 2,

35
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:24,129
which is less than 5. So, we leave it as 5.85.

36
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:29,212
Second, round 7.156 to 2 decimal places.

37
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:34,699
The second digit is 5, but the next digit is 6. Since 6 is 5

38
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:39,648
or more, we round up the 5 to a 6. The answer is 7.16.

39
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:45,085
Third, round 0.274 to 1 decimal place.

40
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:49,113
The first digit is 2. The next is 7, which

41
00:02:49,213 --> 00:02:53,739
is high enough to round up. So, 0.2 becomes 0.3.

42
00:02:53,833 --> 00:03:00,525
Finally, 15.3518 to 1 decimal place. The next digit is 5, so

43
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:05,619
we round up the 3 to a 4. The result is 15.4.

44
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,639
Now, let's look at multiplying two decimal numbers. The easiest way

45
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:15,772
to do this is to temporarily forget about the decimal points.

46
00:03:15,866 --> 00:03:21,848
First, multiply each decimal by a power of 10—like

47
00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:27,809
10, 100, or 1000—to turn them into whole numbers.

48
00:03:27,866 --> 00:03:31,632
Second, multiply those whole numbers together.

49
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:36,399
Third, multiply the powers of 10 you used in step one.

50
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:40,317
Finally, divide your result by that combined power of 10

51
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:43,916
to put the decimal point back in the correct place.

52
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,232
Let's calculate 3.42 multiplied by 2.7.

53
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:55,812
First, we make them whole numbers. 3.42 has two decimal

54
00:03:55,912 --> 00:03:59,995
places, so we multiply by 100 to get 342.

55
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:05,889
2.7 has one decimal place, so we multiply by 10 to get 27.

56
00:04:05,966 --> 00:04:09,997
Now we calculate 342 times 27.

57
00:04:10,097 --> 00:04:15,505
Using long multiplication, we get 9,234.

58
00:04:15,566 --> 00:04:22,389
We multiplied by 100 and then by 10. 100 times 10 is 1,000.

59
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:28,035
So, we must divide our answer, 9,234, by 1,000. This

60
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:33,409
moves the decimal point three places to the left.

61
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,762
The final answer is 9.234.

62
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:43,635
Dividing by a decimal number can be tricky. The best strategy is to

63
00:04:43,735 --> 00:04:47,905
change the problem so you are dividing by a whole number instead.

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,648
Look at the divisor—the number you are dividing by. Decide what you

65
00:04:53,748 --> 00:04:57,852
need to multiply it by to make it a whole number.

66
00:04:57,933 --> 00:05:02,235
Then, multiply BOTH parts of the division by that same amount. This

67
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:06,505
keeps the answer the same, but makes the calculation much easier.

68
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,362
Let's try 42 divided by 0.2.

69
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:15,607
We are dividing by 0.2. To make 0.2 a

70
00:05:15,707 --> 00:05:19,412
whole number, we need to multiply it by 10.

71
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,075
So, we must also multiply 42 by 10.

72
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:32,269
The calculation changes from 42 divided by 0.2... to 420 divided by 2.

73
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:36,629
420 divided by 2 is easy: it is 210.

74
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:41,589
So, 42 divided by 0.2 is 210.

75
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:48,519
Now a harder one: 19.8 divided by 0.55.

76
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,976
The divisor is 0.55. To make this a

77
00:05:52,076 --> 00:05:56,049
whole number, we need to multiply by 100.

78
00:05:56,133 --> 00:06:03,582
So we multiply 19.8 by 100 as well, which gives us 1,980.

79
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:07,624
Our new problem is 1,980 divided by 55. We

80
00:06:07,724 --> 00:06:12,552
can use long division or repeated subtraction here.

81
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:21,172
20 times 55 is 1,100. Subtracting that from 1,980 leaves 880.

82
00:06:21,266 --> 00:06:25,114
8 times 55 is 440. We can subtract

83
00:06:25,214 --> 00:06:29,525
that twice to clear the remaining 880.

84
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:38,668
20 plus 8 plus 8 equals 36. So, 19.8 divided by 0.55 is 36.

85
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,943
To summarize, we've seen that decimals are

86
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:45,619
just another way to represent fractions.

87
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,891
When rounding, always look at the digit immediately

88
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,085
to the right of your target place.

89
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:55,086
For multiplication, treat them as whole numbers first, then

90
00:06:55,186 --> 00:06:57,675
put the decimal point back at the end.

91
00:06:57,766 --> 00:07:00,960
And for division, always adjust the problem so

92
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,465
you are dividing by a whole number.

93
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,620
With these methods, you can handle

94
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,232
any decimal calculation with confidence.
