00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,689
Welcome to this lesson on solving real-life problems. Throughout your

2
00:00:03,789 --> 00:00:06,929
maths course and in daily life, you will encounter problems

3
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:10,443
set in real-world contexts. These require you to read carefully,

4
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:13,793
plan a strategy, and apply arithmetic skills. In this lesson,

5
00:00:13,893 --> 00:00:17,033
we will look at how to approach these problems effectively,

6
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:19,779
using long multiplication and division strategies.

7
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:24,285
When facing a word problem, it's helpful to have a

8
00:00:24,385 --> 00:00:28,620
consistent approach. First, read the question carefully to identify the

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,749
key information. Second, plan your strategy—decide which mathematical operations you

10
00:00:33,849 --> 00:00:37,351
need to use. Third, perform the calculation. You might need

11
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:40,953
to use long multiplication or long division if a calculator

12
00:00:41,053 --> 00:00:44,982
isn't allowed. Finally, always check your answer. Ask yourself: is

13
00:00:45,082 --> 00:00:47,669
this a reasonable number for this situation?

14
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:54,425
Let's apply this to an example. A supermarket receives a delivery

15
00:00:54,525 --> 00:00:58,660
of 235 cases of tins of beans. Each case contains 24

16
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,952
tins. We need to calculate how many tins the supermarket receives

17
00:01:04,052 --> 00:01:08,756
altogether. Since we have 235 groups of 24, our strategy is

18
00:01:08,856 --> 00:01:13,479
multiplication. We need to calculate 235 multiplied by 24.

19
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:18,891
There are several ways to perform this calculation. You should

20
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:22,500
use the method you are most comfortable with. Let's start

21
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,729
with the Grid Method, also known as the Box Method.

22
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:34,059
We break 235 into 200, 30, and 5. We break 24 into 20 and 4.

23
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:40,904
Now we multiply each part. 200 times 20 is 4,000.

24
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:46,232
30 times 20 is 600. 5 times 20 is 100.

25
00:01:46,266 --> 00:01:51,680
Then we multiply by 4: 200 times 4 is 800.

26
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,276
30 times 4 is 120. 5 times 4 is 20.

27
00:01:56,333 --> 00:02:01,317
Finally, we add all these answers together:

28
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:05,219
4,000 plus 600 plus 100 is 4,700.

29
00:02:05,266 --> 00:02:09,529
800 plus 120 plus 20 is 940.

30
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:16,579
Adding 4,700 and 940 gives us a total of 5,640.

31
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,835
Now let's look at the Column Method.

32
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:28,212
First, we multiply 235 by 4. 4 times 5 is

33
00:02:28,312 --> 00:02:32,205
20, so write the 0 and carry the 2.

34
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,974
4 times 3 is 12, plus the carried 2

35
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:39,749
is 14. Write the 4 and carry the 1.

36
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:45,689
4 times 2 is 8, plus the 1 is 9. This gives us 940.

37
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:49,004
Next, we multiply by the 20. We start

38
00:02:49,104 --> 00:02:52,432
by placing a zero in the units column.

39
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,885
Then, 2 times 5 is 10; write 0, carry 1.

40
00:02:57,966 --> 00:03:02,229
2 times 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7.

41
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:07,699
2 times 2 is 4. This gives us 4,700.

42
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:15,712
Finally, we add 940 and 4,700 together to get 5,640.

43
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:26,216
Both methods give us the same result: 5,640 tins.

44
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,391
Now for the second part of the problem. We are told that

45
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:35,741
5% of the tins were damaged and thrown away. The supermarket sells

46
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:38,970
250 tins a day. We need to find out how many days

47
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:43,584
the remaining beans will last. This is a multi-step problem. First, we

48
00:03:43,684 --> 00:03:48,198
must calculate how many tins are left after removing the damaged ones.

49
00:03:48,298 --> 00:03:51,889
Second, we divide that number by the daily sales of 250.

50
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:59,319
Let's work through the numbers. We started with 5,640 tins. To

51
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:03,953
find 5%, we can first find 10%, which is 564. 5%

52
00:04:04,053 --> 00:04:07,622
is half of 10%, so half of 564 is 282.

53
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:13,621
We subtract these damaged tins from the total: 5,640

54
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:18,832
minus 282 leaves us with 5,358 saleable tins.

55
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:25,879
Now we need to divide 5,358 by 250 to find the number of days.

56
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:30,025
We can estimate this. We know that 4 lots of

57
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:35,035
250 make 1,000. Therefore, 20 lots of 250 make 5,000.

58
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:42,549
If we subtract 5,000 from 5,358, we are left with 358.

59
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:49,142
How many 250s are in 358? There is 1 lot of 250, with a remainder.

60
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:54,514
So, we have 20 days plus 1 day, giving us 21 full days. The remainder

61
00:04:54,614 --> 00:04:59,739
means we have a few beans left over, but not enough for a 22nd day.

62
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:06,778
Let's look at a second example. A party of 613 children and 59 adults

63
00:05:06,878 --> 00:05:12,242
are going to a theme park. We need to determine how many coaches are

64
00:05:12,342 --> 00:05:18,108
needed if each holds 53 people. First, we find the total number of people

65
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:23,894
by adding 613 and 59, which gives us 672. The strategy here is division:

66
00:05:23,994 --> 00:05:28,635
we divide the total people, 672, by the coach capacity, 53.

67
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:36,089
We need to calculate 672 divided by 53 using long division.

68
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:40,131
First, how many 53s go into 67? The answer

69
00:05:40,231 --> 00:05:43,616
is 1. We write the 1 above the line.

70
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:50,208
1 times 53 is 53. Subtracting 53 from 67 gives us 14.

71
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,066
Now, bring down the 2 to make 142.

72
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:59,586
How many 53s go into 142? Let's estimate. 50 times 2 is 100. 50

73
00:05:59,686 --> 00:06:04,109
times 3 is 150, which is too high. So it must be 2.

74
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:09,552
We write the 2 above the line. 2 times 53 is 106.

75
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:14,788
Subtracting 106 from 142 leaves a remainder of

76
00:06:14,888 --> 00:06:19,015
36. So the answer is 12 remainder 36.

77
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:28,990
Now we must interpret this answer. The 12 represents full coaches. The

78
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:39,409
remainder of 36 represents 36 people still waiting. We need another coach

79
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:46,402
for them. So, we round up to 13 coaches in total.

80
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,842
Finally, let's look at the entry costs. One adult gets in free

81
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:57,465
for every 15 children. We need to find out how many adults

82
00:06:57,565 --> 00:07:01,849
must pay. We divide the number of children, 613, by 15.

83
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:05,716
We know that 2 times 15 is 30, so 4

84
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:10,819
times 15 is 60. Therefore, 40 times 15 is 600.

85
00:07:10,866 --> 00:07:14,854
We have 613 children, so we have 40 groups of 15, with

86
00:07:14,954 --> 00:07:19,321
13 children left over. Since we get one free adult for each

87
00:07:19,421 --> 00:07:22,652
full group of 15, 40 adults get in for free.

88
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:26,431
The question asks how many adults must pay. There are 59

89
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:30,229
adults in total. We subtract the 40 free places from 59,

90
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:33,552
which tells us that 19 adults must pay to get in.

91
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,466
To summarize, solving real-life problems is about more than just

92
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:42,419
calculation. It requires reading the context carefully to understand what

93
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:45,886
is being asked. You need to choose an appropriate method—whether

94
00:07:45,986 --> 00:07:49,839
that's long multiplication or division. And crucially, you must interpret

95
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:53,143
your answers back into the context of the problem, especially

96
00:07:53,243 --> 00:07:56,338
when dealing with remainders. Always take a moment to check

97
00:07:56,438 --> 00:07:57,909
if your answer is reasonable.
