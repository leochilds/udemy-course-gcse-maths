00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,195
Welcome to this lesson on solving real-life problems.

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:06,118
Throughout your maths course and in daily life,

3
00:00:06,218 --> 00:00:09,539
you will encounter problems set in real-world contexts.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,845
These require you to read carefully, plan

5
00:00:12,945 --> 00:00:16,108
a strategy, and apply arithmetic skills.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,360
In this lesson, we will look at how to approach

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,772
these problems effectively, using long multiplication and division strategies.

8
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,442
When facing a word problem, it's

9
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:33,065
helpful to have a consistent approach.

10
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:38,519
First, read the question carefully to identify the key information.

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,850
Second, plan your strategy—decide which mathematical

12
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,108
operations you need to use.

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,913
Third, perform the calculation. You might need to use long

14
00:00:49,013 --> 00:00:52,988
multiplication or long division if a calculator isn't allowed.

15
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:56,767
Finally, always check your answer. Ask yourself: is

16
00:00:56,867 --> 00:01:00,045
this a reasonable number for this situation?

17
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:04,772
Let's apply this to an example.

18
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:08,379
A supermarket receives a delivery of two hundred

19
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,342
and thirty-five cases of tins of beans.

20
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:15,199
Each case contains twenty-four tins.

21
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:17,135
We need to calculate how many

22
00:01:17,235 --> 00:01:19,965
tins the supermarket receives altogether.

23
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:23,068
Since we have two hundred and thirty-five groups of

24
00:01:23,168 --> 00:01:27,063
twenty-four, our strategy is multiplication. We need to calculate

25
00:01:27,163 --> 00:01:30,382
two hundred and thirty-five multiplied by twenty-four.

26
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:35,758
There are several ways to perform this calculation. You should

27
00:01:35,858 --> 00:01:39,367
use the method you are most comfortable with. Let's start

28
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:42,595
with the Grid Method, also known as the Box Method.

29
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:45,017
We break two hundred and thirty-five

30
00:01:45,117 --> 00:01:47,399
into two hundred, thirty, and five.

31
00:01:47,466 --> 00:01:51,232
We break twenty-four into twenty and four.

32
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:57,775
Now we multiply each part. Two hundred times twenty is four thousand.

33
00:01:57,866 --> 00:02:01,632
Thirty times twenty is six hundred.

34
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:05,432
Five times twenty is one hundred.

35
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:09,729
Then we multiply by four: Two hundred times four is eight hundred.

36
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,062
Thirty times four is one hundred and twenty.

37
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:17,272
Five times four is twenty.

38
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:21,322
Finally, we add all these answers together: Four thousand plus

39
00:02:21,422 --> 00:02:25,279
six hundred plus one hundred is four thousand seven hundred.

40
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:28,663
Eight hundred plus one hundred and twenty

41
00:02:28,763 --> 00:02:31,842
plus twenty is nine hundred and forty.

42
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:36,156
Adding four thousand seven hundred and nine hundred and forty gives

43
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:39,382
us a total of five thousand six hundred and forty.

44
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:43,635
Now let's look at the Column Method.

45
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:51,165
First, we multiply two hundred and thirty-five by four.

46
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:55,495
Four times five is twenty, so write the zero and carry the two.

47
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:59,161
Four times three is twelve, plus the carried two

48
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:02,702
is fourteen. Write the four and carry the one.

49
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,927
Four times two is eight, plus the one is

50
00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:09,432
nine. This gives us nine hundred and forty.

51
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,155
Next, we multiply by the twenty. We start

52
00:03:13,255 --> 00:03:16,635
by placing a zero in the units column.

53
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:22,555
Then, two times five is ten; write zero, carry one.

54
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:27,365
Two times three is six, plus one is seven.

55
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:32,365
Two times two is four. This gives us four thousand seven hundred.

56
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:36,740
Finally, we add nine hundred and forty and four thousand seven

57
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,005
hundred together to get five thousand six hundred and forty.

58
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:46,468
Both methods give us the same result:

59
00:03:46,568 --> 00:03:49,942
five thousand six hundred and forty tins.

60
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:54,672
Now for the second part of the problem.

61
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:57,141
We are told that five percent of

62
00:03:57,241 --> 00:04:00,119
the tins were damaged and thrown away.

63
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,462
The supermarket sells two hundred and fifty tins a day.

64
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:08,126
We need to find out how many days the remaining beans will

65
00:04:08,226 --> 00:04:12,519
last. This is a multi-step problem. First, we must calculate how many

66
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:16,912
tins are left after removing the damaged ones. Second, we divide that

67
00:04:17,012 --> 00:04:20,159
number by the daily sales of two hundred and fifty.

68
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,129
Let's work through the numbers. We started with

69
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:28,208
five thousand six hundred and forty tins.

70
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,576
To find five percent, we can first find

71
00:04:31,676 --> 00:04:35,906
ten percent, which is five hundred and sixty-four.

72
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:39,245
Five percent is half of ten percent, so half of

73
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:43,416
five hundred and sixty-four is two hundred and eighty-two.

74
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,853
We subtract these damaged tins from the total: five thousand

75
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,363
six hundred and forty minus two hundred and eighty-two leaves

76
00:04:50,463 --> 00:04:54,162
us with five thousand three hundred and fifty-eight saleable tins.

77
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:57,979
Now we need to divide five thousand three hundred and fifty-eight

78
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,055
by two hundred and fifty to find the number of days.

79
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,012
We can estimate this. We know that four lots

80
00:05:04,112 --> 00:05:06,955
of two hundred and fifty make one thousand.

81
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:11,295
Therefore, twenty lots of two hundred and fifty make five thousand.

82
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:15,027
If we subtract five thousand from five thousand three hundred

83
00:05:15,127 --> 00:05:18,972
and fifty-eight, we are left with three hundred and fifty-eight.

84
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:22,998
How many two hundred and fifties are in three hundred and fifty-eight?

85
00:05:23,098 --> 00:05:26,482
There is one lot of two hundred and fifty, with a remainder.

86
00:05:26,566 --> 00:05:29,427
So, we have twenty days plus one day, giving us

87
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:32,891
twenty-one full days. The remainder means we have a few

88
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:36,419
beans left over, but not enough for a twenty-second day.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,188
Let's look at a second example. A party of six hundred and

90
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:47,068
thirteen children and fifty-nine adults are going to a theme park.

91
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:49,753
We need to determine how many coaches

92
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:52,989
are needed if each holds fifty-three people.

93
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:57,013
First, we find the total number of people by adding six hundred

94
00:05:57,113 --> 00:06:01,639
and thirteen and fifty-nine, which gives us six hundred and seventy-two.

95
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:06,439
The strategy here is division: we divide the total people,

96
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:11,742
six hundred and seventy-two, by the coach capacity, fifty-three.

97
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,814
We need to calculate six hundred and

98
00:06:15,914 --> 00:06:19,808
seventy-two divided by fifty-three using long division.

99
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,627
First, how many fifty-threes go into sixty-seven? The answer

100
00:06:24,727 --> 00:06:27,845
is one. We write the one above the line.

101
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,413
One times fifty-three is fifty-three. Subtracting

102
00:06:31,513 --> 00:06:34,879
fifty-three from sixty-seven gives us fourteen.

103
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:39,229
Now, bring down the two to make one hundred and forty-two.

104
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,968
How many fifty-threes go into one

105
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,155
hundred and forty-two? Let's estimate.

106
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:48,999
Fifty times two is one hundred.

107
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:52,293
Fifty times three is one hundred and fifty, which

108
00:06:52,393 --> 00:06:54,419
is too high. So it must be two.

109
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,489
We write the two above the line. Two

110
00:06:57,589 --> 00:07:01,008
times fifty-three is one hundred and six.

111
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,412
Subtracting one hundred and six from one hundred

112
00:07:04,512 --> 00:07:07,966
and forty-two leaves a remainder of thirty-six. So

113
00:07:08,066 --> 00:07:10,952
the answer is twelve remainder thirty-six.

114
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:16,575
Now we must interpret this answer. The twelve represents full coaches.

115
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:20,931
The remainder of thirty-six represents thirty-six people still

116
00:07:21,031 --> 00:07:23,769
waiting. We need another coach for them.

117
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:28,095
So, we round up to thirteen coaches in total.

118
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,759
Finally, let's look at the entry costs. One

119
00:07:32,859 --> 00:07:36,175
adult gets in free for every fifteen children.

120
00:07:36,266 --> 00:07:39,560
We need to find out how many adults must pay. We

121
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,369
divide the number of children, six hundred and thirteen, by fifteen.

122
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:46,880
We know that two times fifteen is

123
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,852
thirty, so four times fifteen is sixty.

124
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:54,195
Therefore, forty times fifteen is six hundred.

125
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,846
We have six hundred and thirteen children, so we have

126
00:07:57,946 --> 00:08:01,872
forty groups of fifteen, with thirteen children left over.

127
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:04,912
Since we get one free adult for each full

128
00:08:05,012 --> 00:08:08,442
group of fifteen, forty adults get in for free.

129
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:11,572
The question asks how many adults must

130
00:08:11,672 --> 00:08:15,042
pay. There are fifty-nine adults in total.

131
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:20,154
We subtract the forty free places from fifty-nine, which tells

132
00:08:20,254 --> 00:08:23,705
us that nineteen adults must pay to get in.

133
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,939
To summarize, solving real-life problems is

134
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,808
about more than just calculation.

135
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,798
It requires reading the context carefully

136
00:08:34,898 --> 00:08:37,285
to understand what is being asked.

137
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:39,773
You need to choose an appropriate

138
00:08:39,873 --> 00:08:43,875
method—whether that's long multiplication or division.

139
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:47,443
And crucially, you must interpret your answers back into the

140
00:08:47,543 --> 00:08:51,259
context of the problem, especially when dealing with remainders.

141
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,562
Always take a moment to check if your answer is reasonable.
