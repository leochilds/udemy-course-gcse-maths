00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,437
Welcome to the first section of your GCSE Maths course. Number.

2
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:08,042
This section covers the fundamental building blocks of mathematics. Whether you're

3
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:11,917
managing household finances, planning a project, or just want to feel

4
00:00:12,017 --> 00:00:15,399
more confident with figures, the skills we will cover here are

5
00:00:15,499 --> 00:00:19,442
essential. In this brief introduction, we'll outline what you can expect

6
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:22,025
to learn and why these skills are so valuable.

7
00:00:23,533 --> 00:00:27,795
In this section, we will guide you through several key topics.

8
00:00:27,866 --> 00:00:31,452
We'll start by ensuring you are comfortable calculating

9
00:00:31,552 --> 00:00:35,472
with both whole numbers—which we call integers—and decimals.

10
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:37,755
We will look at how to round numbers,

11
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:40,265
which is a crucial skill for estimation.

12
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:45,033
You'll explore the properties of numbers, including factors, multiples,

13
00:00:45,133 --> 00:00:48,279
and prime numbers, as well as squares and cubes.

14
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,673
We will also cover how to find the

15
00:00:50,773 --> 00:00:54,189
Lowest Common Multiple and Highest Common Factor,

16
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:58,999
and finally, we'll master the rules for working with negative numbers.

17
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:05,829
Before we begin, it's helpful to know where we're starting from.

18
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,536
You should already be familiar with the four basic

19
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:15,439
operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using integers.

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,594
You should also have some recognition of what multiples, factors,

21
00:01:19,694 --> 00:01:22,949
and prime numbers are, even if you need a refresher.

22
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:27,801
Familiarity with the order of operations—often remembered by

23
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:32,102
the acronym BIDMAS or BODMAS—will also be beneficial,

24
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,815
along with the ability to substitute

25
00:01:34,915 --> 00:01:38,022
numbers into simple algebraic expressions.

26
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,145
If any of these sound daunting, don't worry; we

27
00:01:41,245 --> 00:01:43,955
will build up your understanding as we go.

28
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:50,122
Mathematics isn't just about exams; it's a vital

29
00:01:50,222 --> 00:01:53,042
tool for the workplace and daily life.

30
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:56,567
Consider a cashier who needs to give the correct change, or a

31
00:01:56,667 --> 00:02:00,739
delivery driver planning the most efficient route to save fuel and time.

32
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,521
Pilots use maths to calculate fuel requirements and

33
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:09,391
navigation, while doctors must calculate precise medicine dosages

34
00:02:09,491 --> 00:02:12,089
based on a patient's age and weight.

35
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:17,407
One of the most important skills you'll develop is knowing when

36
00:02:17,507 --> 00:02:22,952
an estimation is sufficient and when an exact answer is required.

37
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,757
To summarize, this section is designed to make

38
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:32,479
you competent and confident in basic number skills.

39
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:35,848
We will focus not just on the abstract rules, but on how

40
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:40,016
to apply them to identify and solve problems in real-life situations.

41
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,945
This preparation is key for the world of work

42
00:02:43,045 --> 00:02:45,955
and for the rest of your mathematical journey.

43
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:49,211
When you are ready, move on to the next lesson, where

44
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:53,169
we will start applying these skills to solve real-life problems.
