00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,178
Welcome to the first section of your GCSE Maths course: Number.

2
00:00:03,278 --> 00:00:07,446
This section covers the fundamental building blocks of mathematics. Whether you're

3
00:00:07,546 --> 00:00:11,037
managing household finances, planning a project, or just want to feel

4
00:00:11,137 --> 00:00:14,264
more confident with figures, the skills we will cover here are

5
00:00:14,364 --> 00:00:18,012
essential. In this brief introduction, we'll outline what you can expect

6
00:00:18,112 --> 00:00:20,406
to learn and why these skills are so valuable.

7
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:25,182
In this section, we will guide you through several key topics.

8
00:00:25,282 --> 00:00:29,018
We'll start by ensuring you are comfortable calculating with both whole

9
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,638
numbers—which we call integers—and decimals. We will look at how to

10
00:00:32,738 --> 00:00:36,420
round numbers, which is a crucial skill for estimation. You'll explore

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,634
the properties of numbers, including factors, multiples, and prime numbers, as

12
00:00:40,734 --> 00:00:43,443
well as squares and cubes. We will also cover how to

13
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:47,279
find the Lowest Common Multiple and Highest Common Factor, and finally,

14
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:50,359
we'll master the rules for working with negative numbers.

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,488
Before we begin, it's helpful to know where we're starting from.

16
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:59,637
You should already be familiar with the four basic operations: addition,

17
00:00:59,737 --> 00:01:04,420
subtraction, multiplication, and division using integers. You should also have some

18
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,454
recognition of what multiples, factors, and prime numbers are, even if

19
00:01:08,554 --> 00:01:13,007
you need a refresher. Familiarity with the order of operations—often remembered

20
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:16,868
by the acronym BIDMAS or BODMAS—will also be beneficial, along with

21
00:01:16,968 --> 00:01:21,190
the ability to substitute numbers into simple algebraic expressions. If any

22
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,590
of these sound daunting, don't worry; we will build up your

23
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,915
understanding as we go.

24
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:30,786
Mathematics isn't just about exams; it's a vital tool for the

25
00:01:30,886 --> 00:01:34,261
workplace and daily life. Consider a cashier who needs to give

26
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:38,073
the correct change, or a delivery driver planning the most efficient

27
00:01:38,173 --> 00:01:41,325
route to save fuel and time. Pilots use maths to calculate

28
00:01:41,425 --> 00:01:46,202
fuel requirements and navigation, while doctors must calculate precise medicine dosages

29
00:01:46,302 --> 00:01:49,117
based on a patient's age and weight. One of the most

30
00:01:49,217 --> 00:01:53,321
important skills you'll develop is knowing when an estimation is sufficient

31
00:01:53,421 --> 00:01:55,396
and when an exact answer is required.

32
00:01:56,966 --> 00:02:00,245
To summarize, this section is designed to make you competent and

33
00:02:00,345 --> 00:02:03,359
confident in basic number skills. We will focus not just on

34
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:06,316
the abstract rules, but on how to apply them to identify

35
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:10,064
and solve problems in real-life situations. This preparation is key for

36
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:12,967
the world of work and for the rest of your mathematical

37
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:15,923
journey. When you are ready, move on to the next lesson,

38
00:02:16,023 --> 00:02:19,619
where we will start applying these skills to solve real-life problems.
