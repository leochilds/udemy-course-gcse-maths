00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,578
Welcome to the first section of your GCSE Maths course. Number. This

2
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,094
section covers the fundamental building blocks of {M AE2 TH M AE1

3
00:00:07,194 --> 00:00:11,152
T IH0 K S}. Whether you're managing household finances, planning a project,

4
00:00:11,252 --> 00:00:14,560
or just want to feel more confident with figures, the skills we

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,725
will cover here are essential. In this brief introduction, we'll outline what

6
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:22,025
you can expect to learn and why these skills are so valuable.

7
00:00:23,533 --> 00:00:26,782
In this section, we will guide you through several key topics.

8
00:00:26,882 --> 00:00:30,618
We'll start by ensuring you are comfortable calculating with both whole

9
00:00:30,718 --> 00:00:34,238
numbers—which we call integers—and decimals. We will look at how to

10
00:00:34,338 --> 00:00:38,020
round numbers, which is a crucial skill for estimation. You'll explore

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,234
the properties of numbers, including factors, multiples, and prime numbers, as

12
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:45,043
well as squares and cubes. We will also cover how to

13
00:00:45,143 --> 00:00:48,879
find the Lowest Common Multiple and Highest Common Factor, and finally,

14
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:51,959
we'll master the rules for working with negative numbers.

15
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,088
Before we begin, it's helpful to know where we're starting from.

16
00:00:57,188 --> 00:01:01,237
You should already be familiar with the four basic operations: addition,

17
00:01:01,337 --> 00:01:06,020
subtraction, multiplication, and division using integers. You should also have some

18
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,054
recognition of what multiples, factors, and prime numbers are, even if

19
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:14,607
you need a refresher. Familiarity with the order of operations—often remembered

20
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:18,468
by the acronym BIDMAS or BODMAS—will also be beneficial, along with

21
00:01:18,568 --> 00:01:22,790
the ability to substitute numbers into simple algebraic expressions. If any

22
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,190
of these sound daunting, don't worry; we will build up your

23
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,515
understanding as we go.

24
00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:32,386
Mathematics isn't just about exams; it's a vital tool for the

25
00:01:32,486 --> 00:01:35,861
workplace and daily life. Consider a cashier who needs to give

26
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:39,673
the correct change, or a delivery driver planning the most efficient

27
00:01:39,773 --> 00:01:42,925
route to save fuel and time. Pilots use maths to calculate

28
00:01:43,025 --> 00:01:47,802
fuel requirements and navigation, while doctors must calculate precise medicine dosages

29
00:01:47,902 --> 00:01:50,717
based on a patient's age and weight. One of the most

30
00:01:50,817 --> 00:01:54,921
important skills you'll develop is knowing when an estimation is sufficient

31
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:56,996
and when an exact answer is required.

32
00:01:58,566 --> 00:02:01,845
To summarize, this section is designed to make you competent and

33
00:02:01,945 --> 00:02:04,959
confident in basic number skills. We will focus not just on

34
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:07,916
the abstract rules, but on how to apply them to identify

35
00:02:08,016 --> 00:02:11,664
and solve problems in real-life situations. This preparation is key for

36
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:14,567
the world of work and for the rest of your mathematical

37
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:17,523
journey. When you are ready, move on to the next lesson,

38
00:02:17,623 --> 00:02:21,219
where we will start applying these skills to solve real-life problems.
