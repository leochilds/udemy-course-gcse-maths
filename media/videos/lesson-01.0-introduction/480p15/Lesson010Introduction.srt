00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,535
Welcome to the first section of your GCSE Maths course: Number.

2
00:00:04,635 --> 00:00:10,569
This section covers the fundamental building blocks of mathematics. Whether you're

3
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:15,646
managing household finances, planning a project, or just want to feel

4
00:00:15,746 --> 00:00:20,209
more confident with figures, the skills we will cover here are

5
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:25,507
essential. In this brief introduction, we'll outline what you can expect

6
00:00:25,607 --> 00:00:28,892
to learn and why these skills are so valuable.

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,034
In this section, we will guide you through several key topics.

8
00:00:35,134 --> 00:00:40,456
We'll start by ensuring you are comfortable calculating with both whole

9
00:00:40,556 --> 00:00:45,572
numbers—which we call integers—and decimals. We will look at how to

10
00:00:45,672 --> 00:00:50,918
round numbers, which is a crucial skill for estimation. You'll explore

11
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:56,874
the properties of numbers, including factors, multiples, and prime numbers, as

12
00:00:56,974 --> 00:01:00,845
well as squares and cubes. We will also cover how to

13
00:01:00,945 --> 00:01:06,267
find the Lowest Common Multiple and Highest Common Factor, and finally,

14
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:10,620
we'll master the rules for working with negative numbers.

15
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:17,175
Before we begin, it's helpful to know where we're starting from.

16
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:22,961
You should already be familiar with the four basic operations: addition,

17
00:01:23,061 --> 00:01:29,630
subtraction, multiplication, and division using integers. You should also have some

18
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:35,254
recognition of what multiples, factors, and prime numbers are, even if

19
00:01:35,354 --> 00:01:41,602
you need a refresher. Familiarity with the order of operations—often remembered

20
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:46,986
by the acronym BIDMAS or BODMAS—will also be beneficial, along with

21
00:01:47,086 --> 00:01:53,012
the ability to substitute numbers into simple algebraic expressions. If any

22
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:57,753
of these sound daunting, don't worry; we will build up your

23
00:01:57,853 --> 00:01:59,601
understanding as we go.

24
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:05,562
Mathematics isn't just about exams; it's a vital tool for the

25
00:02:05,662 --> 00:02:10,166
workplace and daily life. Consider a cashier who needs to give

26
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:15,216
the correct change, or a delivery driver planning the most efficient

27
00:02:15,316 --> 00:02:19,523
route to save fuel and time. Pilots use maths to calculate

28
00:02:19,623 --> 00:02:25,983
fuel requirements and navigation, while doctors must calculate precise medicine dosages

29
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:29,844
based on a patient's age and weight. One of the most

30
00:02:29,944 --> 00:02:35,413
important skills you'll develop is knowing when an estimation is sufficient

31
00:02:35,513 --> 00:02:38,161
and when an exact answer is required.

32
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:44,171
To summarize, this section is designed to make you competent and

33
00:02:44,271 --> 00:02:48,415
confident in basic number skills. We will focus not just on

34
00:02:48,515 --> 00:02:52,444
the abstract rules, but on how to apply them to identify

35
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:57,552
and solve problems in real-life situations. This preparation is key for

36
00:02:57,652 --> 00:03:01,509
the world of work and for the rest of your mathematical

37
00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:05,538
journey. When you are ready, move on to the next lesson,

38
00:03:05,638 --> 00:03:10,574
where we will start applying these skills to solve real-life problems.
