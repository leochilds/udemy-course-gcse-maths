## Slide 1: What is a Fraction?

### Content
- A fraction represents part of a whole
- Written as one number over another: ½, ¾, ⅗
- Top number = numerator
- Bottom number = denominator

### Narration
Welcome to this lesson on understanding fractions. A fraction is a way of representing a part of a whole. When we write a fraction, we use two numbers: one written above the other, separated by a line. [pause] The number on top is called the numerator, and it tells us how many parts we have. The number on the bottom is called the denominator, and it tells us how many equal parts the whole is divided into. For example, if we write one-half, we're saying we have one part out of two equal parts. Let's explore this concept further.

### Visual Materials
- **Type:** Diagram
- **Description:** A circle divided into equal parts with some sections shaded to show ½, ¾, and ⅗. Each fraction is labeled clearly showing which sections are "counted" versus the total divisions.

## Slide 2: Reading Fractions

### Content
- ½ is read as "one half"
- ¼ is read as "one quarter"
- ¾ is read as "three quarters"
- ⅗ is read as "three fifths"

### Narration
Let's look at how we read fractions. The denominator tells us the name of the fraction. When the denominator is 2, we say "half" or "halves". When it's 4, we say "quarter" or "quarters". [pause] For other numbers, we typically add "th" or "ths" to the end. So 5 becomes "fifth" or "fifths", 8 becomes "eighth" or "eighths", and so on. The numerator tells us how many of these parts we have. So three-fifths means we have three parts, where each part is one-fifth of the whole.

## Slide 3: Equivalent Fractions

### Content
- Different fractions can represent the same amount
- ½ = 2/4 = 4/8
- Multiply or divide both numerator and denominator by the same number
- The value stays the same

### Narration
An important concept to understand is that different fractions can represent exactly the same amount. These are called equivalent fractions. [pause] For example, one-half is equivalent to two-quarters, which is also equivalent to four-eighths. Let me explain why this works. If we take one-half and multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2, we get two over four, or two-quarters. If we multiply both by 4, we get four over eight, or four-eighths. [pause] The key rule is this: when you multiply or divide both the numerator and the denominator by the same number, the value of the fraction doesn't change. This is because you're essentially multiplying or dividing by one, just written in a different form.

### Visual Materials
- **Type:** Diagram
- **Description:** Three rectangles of the same size: one divided into 2 parts with 1 shaded, one divided into 4 parts with 2 shaded, and one divided into 8 parts with 4 shaded. This visually demonstrates that ½ = 2/4 = 4/8.

## Slide 4: Simplifying Fractions

### Content
- Simplifying means reducing to smallest equivalent form
- Find the highest common factor of numerator and denominator
- Divide both by this number
- Example: 6/8 = 3/4 (both divided by 2)

### Narration
Now let's look at simplifying fractions, which is also called reducing fractions. To simplify a fraction means to write it in its smallest equivalent form. [pause] The process is straightforward: find the highest common factor of both the numerator and the denominator, then divide both numbers by that factor. Let's work through an example. If we have six-eighths, we notice that both 6 and 8 can be divided by 2. When we divide the numerator 6 by 2, we get 3. When we divide the denominator 8 by 2, we get 4. So six-eighths simplifies to three-quarters. [pause] These fractions are equivalent - they represent the same amount - but three-quarters is the simplified form because 3 and 4 have no common factors other than 1.

## Slide 5: Summary

### Content
- Fractions show part of a whole
- Numerator = how many parts we have
- Denominator = total equal parts
- Equivalent fractions represent the same value
- Simplify by dividing both by highest common factor

### Narration
To summarize what we've covered: fractions are a way to represent part of a whole. The numerator tells us how many parts we have, and the denominator tells us how many equal parts the whole is divided into. [pause] We've learned that different fractions can be equivalent, meaning they represent the same amount, and we can find equivalent fractions by multiplying or dividing both the numerator and denominator by the same number. Finally, simplifying a fraction means reducing it to its smallest equivalent form by dividing both parts by their highest common factor. [pause] Understanding these fundamental concepts about fractions will help you work confidently with more complex fraction operations. Thank you for watching.

## Notes
- This is a foundational lesson that introduces fraction concepts without assuming prior knowledge
- Visual diagrams are essential for slides 1 and 3 to help visual learners understand the concept
- Consider creating practice problems as a separate resource or follow-up lesson
- If learners struggle with finding highest common factors, may need a brief recap of factors in the narration
