1.2 Multiplication and division with decimals

This lesson will show you how to:
- multiply a decimal number by another decimal number
- divide by a decimal by changing the calculation to division by an integer.

Key terms:
- decimal place
- decimal point

The number system is extended by using decimal numbers to represent fractions. Teh decimal point separates the decimal fraction from the whole-number part.

For exmaple, the number 25.374 means:
Tens, Units, |, Tenths, Hundreths, Thousandths
10, 1, |, 1/10, 1/100, 1/1000
2, 5, ., 3, 7, 4

You can already use decimal notation to express amounts of money. For example:
£36.67n means 3 x £10
              2 x £1
              6 x £0.10 (10 pence)
              7 x £0.01 (1 penny)

Decimal places
When you write a number in decimal form, the positions of the digits to the right of the decimal point are called decimal places (dp). For example:
79.4 is written 'with one decimal place'
6.83 is written 'with two decimal places'
0.526 is written 'with three decimal places'

These are the steps to round a decimal number to a particular number of decimal places.
- Start at the decimal point and count along the decimal places. Look at the first digit that needs to eb removed.
- When When the value of this digit is less than 5, just remove the unwanted digits.
- When the value of this digit is 5 or more, add 1 to round up the digit in the previous decimal place then remove the unwanted digits. 

Example 3
Round these numebers.
a) 5.852 to 2 dp
b) 7.156 to 2 dp
c) 0.274 to 1 dp
d) 15.3518 to 1 dp

a) 5.852 rounds to 5.85 to 2 dp.
b) 7.156 rounds to 7.16 to 2 dp.
c) 0.274 rounds to 0.3 to 1 dp.
d) 15.3518 rounds to 15.4 to 1 dp.

Multiplying two decimal numbers together
Follow these steps to multiple one decimal number by another decimal number.
1. Multiple each decimal by a power of 10 to make it into a whole number.
2. Multiple the two whole numbers.
3. Multiple together the powers of 10 from step 1.
4. Divide the product of the numbers from step 2 by the power of 10 from step 3.

Example 4
Work out this decimal multiplication. 3.42 x 2.7

Multiply each number by a power of 10 to make it into a whole number.
3.42 x 100 = 342 and 2.7 x 10 = 27.
Multiple the whole numbers together

  342
x  27
-----
 2394
 6840
-----
 9234
-----

Multiple the powers of 10 (100 and 10) together. 100 x 10 = 1000
Divide 9234 by this power of 10. 9234 / 1000 = 9.234
So, 3.42 x 2.7 = 9.234

Dividing by a decimal
Look at the number you are dividing by. Decide what multiple of 10 (10, 100, 1000...) you would need to multiply it by, to make it a whole number or integer.
Then multiple both parts of the division by that multiple of 10.

Example 5
Work these out. a) 42 / 0.2 b) 19.8 / 0.55

a) The calculation is 42 / 0.2, which can be rewritten as 420 / 2. In this case both values have been multiplied by 10 to make the divisor into a whole number. Then divide normally. The answer is 210.
Another way to view this is as a fraction problem.
42/0.2 = 42/0.2 x 10/10 = 420/2 = 210/1 = 210

b) 19.8 / 0.55 = 198 / 5.5 = 1980 / 55

This becomes a long division problem that can be solved using the method of repeated subtraction.

 1980
-1100  20 x 55
-----
  880
- 440  8 x 55
-----
  440
- 440  8 x 55
-----
    0 36 x 55

So, 19.8 / 0.55 = 36
