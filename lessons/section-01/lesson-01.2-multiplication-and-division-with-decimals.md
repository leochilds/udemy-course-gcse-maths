## Slide 2: Decimal Notation

### Content
- **Decimal Point**: Separates whole numbers from fractions
- **Example**: 25.374
  - Tens (10): 2
  - Units (1): 5
  - **.**
  - Tenths (1/10): 3
  - Hundredths (1/100): 7
  - Thousandths (1/1000): 4

### Narration
The number system is extended by using decimal numbers to represent fractions. The decimal point separates the whole-number part from the fractional part.
Take the number 25.374, for example. To the left of the decimal point, we have 2 Tens and 5 Units. To the right, we have 3 Tenths, 7 Hundredths, and 4 Thousandths.
We use this every day with money. £36.67 is simply 3 tens, 6 units, 6 tenths—which are 10 pence coins—and 7 hundredths—which are pennies.

## Slide 3: Decimal Places

### Content
- **Decimal Places (dp)**: Digits to the right of the point
- **Examples**:
  - 79.4 (1 decimal place)
  - 6.83 (2 decimal places)
  - 0.526 (3 decimal places)

### Narration
When we talk about "decimal places," we are referring to the positions of the digits to the right of the decimal point.
For instance, 79.4 has one digit after the point, so it has one decimal place.
6.83 has two digits after the point, so it has two decimal places.
And 0.526 has three decimal places. Knowing this is crucial for rounding and for checking our answers in multiplication.

## Slide 4: Rounding Decimals

### Content
- **Steps to Round**:
  1. Count along to the required decimal place.
  2. Look at the *next* digit (the one to be removed).
  3. **Less than 5**: Just remove unwanted digits.
  4. **5 or more**: Add 1 to previous digit, then remove.

### Narration
Often, you will need to round a decimal number to a specific number of decimal places.
Here is the method: Start at the decimal point and count along to the required number of places. Then, look at the very next digit—the first one you are going to remove.
If that digit is less than 5, you simply remove it and all following digits.
If that digit is 5 or more, you must round up. Add 1 to the digit in the previous decimal place, and then remove the unwanted digits.

## Slide 5: Rounding Examples

### Content
- **Round to specified dp**:
  - a) 5.852 (to 2 dp) → **5.85**
  - b) 7.156 (to 2 dp) → **7.16**
  - c) 0.274 (to 1 dp) → **0.3**
  - d) 15.3518 (to 1 dp) → **15.4**

### Narration
Let's practice this with some examples.
First, round 5.852 to 2 decimal places. The second decimal digit is 5. The next digit is 2, which is less than 5. So, we leave it as 5.85.
Second, round 7.156 to 2 decimal places. The second digit is 5, but the next digit is 6. Since 6 is 5 or more, we round up the 5 to a 6. The answer is 7.16.
Third, round 0.274 to 1 decimal place. The first digit is 2. The next is 7, which is high enough to round up. So, 0.2 becomes 0.3.
Finally, 15.3518 to 1 decimal place. The next digit is 5, so we round up the 3 to a 4. The result is 15.4.

## Slide 6: Multiplying Two Decimals

### Content
- **Method**:
  1. Multiply by powers of 10 to make integers.
  2. Multiply the integers.
  3. Multiply the powers of 10 together.
  4. Divide the result by that total power of 10.

### Narration
Now, let's look at multiplying two decimal numbers.
The easiest way to do this is to temporarily forget about the decimal points.
First, multiply each decimal by a power of 10—like 10, 100, or 1000—to turn them into whole numbers.
Second, multiply those whole numbers together.
Third, multiply the powers of 10 you used in step one.
Finally, divide your result by that combined power of 10 to put the decimal point back in the correct place.

## Slide 7: Multiplication Example

### Content
- **Calculate**: 3.42 × 2.7
- **Step 1**:
  - 3.42 × 100 = 342
  - 2.7 × 10 = 27
- **Step 2**: 342 × 27 = **9234**
- **Step 3**: 100 × 10 = **1000**
- **Step 4**: 9234 ÷ 1000 = **9.234**

### Narration
Let's calculate 3.42 multiplied by 2.7.
First, we make them whole numbers. 3.42 has two decimal places, so we multiply by 100 to get 342. 2.7 has one decimal place, so we multiply by 10 to get 27.
Now we calculate 342 times 27. Using long multiplication, we get 9,234.
We multiplied by 100 and then by 10. 100 times 10 is 1,000.
So, we must divide our answer, 9,234, by 1,000. This moves the decimal point three places to the left.
The final answer is 9.234.

## Slide 8: Dividing by a Decimal

### Content
- **Challenge**: Dividing by a decimal is difficult.
- **Solution**: Make the divisor a whole number.
- **Method**:
  - Identify the divisor (the number you are dividing *by*).
  - Multiply *both* numbers by the same multiple of 10 (10, 100, etc.) until the divisor is an integer.
  - Divide normally.

### Narration
Dividing by a decimal number can be tricky. The best strategy is to change the problem so you are dividing by a whole number instead.
Look at the divisor—the number you are dividing by. Decide what you need to multiply it by to make it a whole number.
Then, multiply *both* parts of the division by that same amount. This keeps the answer the same, but makes the calculation much easier. Think of it like simplifying a fraction.

## Slide 9: Division Example A

### Content
- **Calculate**: 42 ÷ 0.2
- **Transform**:
  - Multiply both by 10
  - 42 × 10 = 420
  - 0.2 × 10 = 2
- **New Calculation**: 420 ÷ 2 = **210**

### Narration
Let's try 42 divided by 0.2.
We are dividing by 0.2. To make 0.2 a whole number, we need to multiply it by 10.
So, we must also multiply 42 by 10.
The calculation changes from 42 divided by 0.2... to 420 divided by 2.
420 divided by 2 is easy: it is 210.
So, 42 divided by 0.2 is 210.

## Slide 10: Division Example B

### Content
- **Calculate**: 19.8 ÷ 0.55
- **Transform**:
  - Multiply by 100 (to clear 0.55)
  - 19.8 × 100 = 1980
  - 0.55 × 100 = 55
- **Calculation**: 1980 ÷ 55
- **Result**: **36**

### Narration
Now a harder one: 19.8 divided by 0.55.
The divisor is 0.55. To make this a whole number, we need to multiply by 100.
So we multiply 19.8 by 100 as well, which gives us 1,980.
Our new problem is 1,980 divided by 55.
We can use long division or repeated subtraction here.
20 times 55 is 1,100. Subtracting that from 1,980 leaves 880.
8 times 55 is 440. We can subtract that twice to clear the remaining 880.
20 plus 8 plus 8 equals 36.
So, 19.8 divided by 0.55 is 36.

## Slide 11: Summary

### Content
- **Decimals**: Represent parts of a whole (tenths, hundredths).
- **Rounding**: Look at the next digit (5 or more rounds up).
- **Multiplication**: Convert to integers, multiply, then divide by total power of 10.
- **Division**: Multiply both numbers to make the divisor an integer.

### Narration
To summarize, we've seen that decimals are just another way to represent fractions, with positions for tenths, hundredths, and so on.
When rounding, always look at the digit immediately to the right of your target place.
For multiplication, treat them as whole numbers first, then put the decimal point back at the end.
And for division, always adjust the problem so you are dividing by a whole number.
With these methods, you can handle any decimal calculation with confidence.
