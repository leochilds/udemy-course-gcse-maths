## Slide 1: Welcome to Section 1

### Content
- **Section 1**: Basic Number Skills
- Foundation of all mathematics
- Essential for daily life and work

### Narration
Welcome to the first section of your GCSE Maths course: Number. This section covers the fundamental building blocks of mathematics. Whether you're managing household finances, planning a project, or just want to feel more confident with figures, the skills we will cover here are essential. In this brief introduction, we'll outline what you can expect to learn and why these skills are so valuable.

## Slide 2: What You Will Learn

### Content
- **Calculations**: Integers and decimals
- **Rounding**: Significant figures and estimation
- **Properties of Numbers**: Multiples, factors, primes, squares, cubes
- **Advanced Tools**: LCM (Lowest Common Multiple), HCF (Highest Common Factor)
- **Negative Numbers**: Rules and calculations

### Narration
In this section, we will guide you through several key topics. We'll start by ensuring you are comfortable calculating with both whole numbers—which we call integers—and decimals. We will look at how to round numbers, which is a crucial skill for estimation. You'll explore the properties of numbers, including factors, multiples, and prime numbers, as well as squares and cubes. We will also cover how to find the Lowest Common Multiple and Highest Common Factor, and finally, we'll master the rules for working with negative numbers.

## Slide 3: Prerequisites

### Content
- **Basic Arithmetic**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- **Knowledge of**: Multiples, factors, square numbers, primes
- **Order of Operations**: BIDMAS/BODMAS
- **Algebra**: Substituting values into simple expressions

### Narration
Before we begin, it's helpful to know where we're starting from. You should already be familiar with the four basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using integers. You should also have some recognition of what multiples, factors, and prime numbers are, even if you need a refresher. Familiarity with the order of operations—often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS or BODMAS—will also be beneficial, along with the ability to substitute numbers into simple algebraic expressions. If any of these sound daunting, don't worry; we will build up your understanding as we go.

## Slide 4: Real-World Applications

### Content
- **Everyday Math**: Cashiers (change), Delivery Drivers (routes)
- **Technical Math**: Pilots (fuel & direction), Doctors (dosages)
- **Key Skill**: Knowing when to estimate vs. calculate exactly

### Narration
Mathematics isn't just about exams; it's a vital tool for the workplace and daily life. Consider a cashier who needs to give the correct change, or a delivery driver planning the most efficient route to save fuel and time. Pilots use maths to calculate fuel requirements and navigation, while doctors must calculate precise medicine dosages based on a patient's age and weight. One of the most important skills you'll develop is knowing when an estimation is sufficient and when an exact answer is required.

## Slide 5: Summary

### Content
- **Goal**: Competence in basic number skills
- **Focus**: Real-life situations and problem solving
- **Next Step**: Lesson 1.1 - Solving Real-Life Problems

### Narration
To summarize, this section is designed to make you competent and confident in basic number skills. We will focus not just on the abstract rules, but on how to apply them to identify and solve problems in real-life situations. This preparation is key for the world of work and for the rest of your mathematical journey. When you are ready, move on to the next lesson, where we will start applying these skills to solve real-life problems.
