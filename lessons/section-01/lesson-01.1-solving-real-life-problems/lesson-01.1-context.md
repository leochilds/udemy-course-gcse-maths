1.1 Solving real-life problems

This section will show you how to:
- solve problems set in real life-context.

Key terms:
- column method (or traditional method)
- grid method (or box method)
- long division
- long multiplication
- strategy

During your maths course, you will meet many problems set in real-life contexts. You will have to read them carefully, think about and then plan a strategy. This may involve arithmetical skills such as long multiplication and long division. You may need to work out the answers with or without a calculator.
There are several ways to do long multiplication or long division without using a calculator, so make sure you are familiar with them and confident in at least one method.
Teh first example show both the grid method (or box method) and the standard column method (or traditional method) for long multiplication. The second example shows one method for long division. In this type of problem it is important to show your working, as you will get marks for correct methods.

Example 1
A supermarket recieves a delivery of 235 cases of tines of beans. Each case contains 24 tines.
a) How many tins of beans does the supermarket recieve altogether?
b) 5% of the tins were damaged. These were thrown away. Teh supermarket knows that it selss, on average, 250 tines of beans a day. How many days iwll the delivery of beans last before a new delivery is needed?

a) The number of tins is worked out by the multiplication 235 x 24.
Use the grid method
x,200,30,5
20,4000,600,100
4,800,120,20

 4000
  600
  100
  800
  120
+  20
-----
 5640
-----

Use the column method

  235
x  24
-----
  940
-----
 4700
-----
 5640
-----

So the answer is 5640 tins.

b) 10% of 5640 is 564, so 5% is 564 / 2 = 282.
This leave 5640 - 282 = 5358 tins to be sold.
There are 21 lots of 250 in 5358 (you should know that 4 x 250 = 1000), so the beasn will last for 21 days before another delivery is needed.

Example 2
A party of 613 children and 59 adults are going ton a day out to a theme park.
a) How many coaches, each holding 53 people, will be needed?
b) One adult gets into the theme park free for every 15 children. How many adults will have to pay to get in?

a) Altogether there are 613 + 59 = 672 people.
So the number of coaches needed is 672 / 53 (number of seats on each coach).

    12
  ----
52|672
   530
   ---
   142
   106
   ---
    36

The answer is 12 remainder 36. So, there will be 12 full coaches and one coach with 36 people on it. They would have to book 13 coaches

b) This is also a division, 613/15. It is useful if you know the 15 times table. As 4 x 15 = 60, 40 x 15 = 600. This leaves a remainder of 13. So 40 adults get in free and 59 - 40 = 19 adults will have to pay.
