About this section
Most jobs require some knowledge of methematics. For any job, you should be competetent in basic number skills fo addition, subtraction, mutliplication and division, using whole numbers, fractions and decimals. You should know when it is sensible to use estimation or approximation and when it is important to have exact answers.
You need to be able to identify the skills required when questions are set in real-life situations, in preparation for the world of work. Here are some examples of methematical problems faced in a range of jobs: cashiers need to know what coins to give in change; pilots need to work out how much fuel they need and what direction to fly the plane; delivery drivers need to work out their best route to save time and fuel; doctors need to know how much medicine to prescibe for different ages and weights of patients.
How many other jobs can you think of that require mathematics?
