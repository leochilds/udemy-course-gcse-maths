0000000001 Section 1 covers Number, specifically Basic Number.
0000000002 This section is going to show you how to calculate integers and decimals.
0000000003 It will show you how to round numbers to a given number of significant figures.
0000000004 You will learn to work out and recognise multiples, factors and prime numbers.
0000000005 You will also learn to recognise squares, cubes and their roots.
0000000006 We will cover how to find the prime factors of a number.
0000000007 You will learn how to work out lowest common multiples, or LCM.
0000000008 We will also cover how to work out highest common factors, or HCF.
0000000009 Finally, we will show you how to calculate with negative numbers.
0000000010 You should already know how to add, subtract, multiply and divide with integers.
0000000011 You should know what multiples, factors, square numbers and prime numbers are.
0000000012 You should be familiar with the BIDMAS or BODMAS rule.
0000000013 And you should know how to substitute values into simple algebraic expressions.
0000000014 Let's talk a bit about this section.
0000000015 Most jobs require some knowledge of mathematics.
0000000016 For any job, you should be competent in basic number skills.
0000000017 This includes addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
0000000018 You should be able to use whole numbers, fractions and decimals.
0000000019 You should know when it is sensible to use estimation or approximation.
0000000020 And you should know when it is important to have exact answers.
0000000021 You need to be able to identify the skills required.
0000000022 This applies when questions are set in real-life situations.
0000000023 This is in preparation for the world of work.
0000000024 Here are some examples of mathematical problems faced in a range of jobs.
0000000025 Cashiers need to know what coins to give in change.
0000000026 Pilots need to work out how much fuel they need.
0000000027 They also need to calculate the direction to fly the plane.
0000000028 Delivery drivers need to work out their best route to save time and fuel.
0000000029 Doctors need to know how much medicine to prescribe.
0000000030 This varies for different ages and weights of patients.
0000000031 How many other jobs can you think of that require mathematics?
