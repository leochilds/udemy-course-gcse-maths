# Narration Style Guide

This guide establishes the voice, tone, and style standards for all narration scripts in the Udemy GCSE Maths Course.

---

## Core Principles

### Target Audience
Our learners are **adults who don't have a GCSE Maths qualification or didn't perform well when they first took it**. This means:

- They may have negative associations with maths from school
- They need encouragement but not condescension
- They want to understand "why" as much as "how"
- They appreciate clear, patient explanations
- They're motivated adults taking control of their education

### Voice and Tone
- **Professional but approachable**: Like a knowledgeable tutor, not a lecturer
- **Encouraging without being patronizing**: Acknowledge challenges but express confidence
- **Clear and patient**: Take time to explain thoroughly
- **Neutral and inclusive**: Avoid assumptions about the learner's background or circumstances

---

## What to AVOID

### ❌ Time-Based References
Since this is pre-recorded and learners watch at their own time:

**DON'T SAY:**
- "Good morning"
- "Good afternoon"
- "Good evening"
- "Let's start today's lesson"
- "Earlier today we..."
- "This morning we looked at..."

**DO SAY:**
- "Welcome to this lesson"
- "In this lesson, we'll explore..."
- "Let's begin"
- "Previously, we looked at..." (if referencing within the same lesson)

### ❌ Academic Jargon Without Explanation
Don't assume high academic background:

**DON'T SAY:**
- "As you know from advanced calculus..."
- "This is trivially obvious..."
- "The corollary of this theorem..."

**DO SAY:**
- "Let me explain what this means..."
- "This might seem complex, but let's break it down..."
- "Here's another way to think about this..."

### ❌ Slang and Informal Language
Keep it professional:

**DON'T SAY:**
- "This is gonna be..."
- "Kinda like..."
- "Tons of..."
- "Super easy"
- "Crazy difficult"

**DO SAY:**
- "This is going to be..."
- "Similar to..."
- "Many..."
- "Straightforward"
- "Challenging"

### ❌ Assumptions About Prior Lessons
Never assume learners have watched other lessons:

**DON'T SAY:**
- "As we learned in the previous lesson..."
- "Remember what we covered about..."
- "Building on lesson 3..."

**DO SAY:**
- "We need to understand that [briefly explain concept]..."
- "Let me quickly recap: [concept]..."
- Self-contained explanations within each lesson

### ❌ Negative or Discouraging Language

**DON'T SAY:**
- "This is really hard"
- "Most people struggle with this"
- "You might not get this right away"
- "This is where people usually give up"

**DO SAY:**
- "This concept requires focus, so let's work through it step by step"
- "This is a challenging topic, but we'll break it down together"
- "Take your time with this - it's worth understanding properly"

## What to INCLUDE

### ✅ Clear Structure
Guide learners through the content:
- "First, let's look at..."
- "Now that we understand X, we can move on to..."
- "There are three key points here..."
- "Let's break this down into steps..."

### ✅ Explanations and Context
Expand on the slide content:
- Explain WHY formulas work, not just HOW to use them
- Provide context for when concepts are useful
- Offer multiple ways of thinking about a concept
- Connect abstract concepts to concrete examples

### ✅ Verbal Signposting
Help learners navigate:
- "The important thing to notice here is..."
- "Let's pause and consider..."
- "To summarize..."
- "The key takeaway is..."

### ✅ Worked Examples with Commentary
Talk through the thinking process:
- "So we start by..."
- "The next step is to... because..."
- "Notice what happens when..."
- "This tells us that..."

### ✅ Encouragement (Subtle)
Build confidence without being patronizing:
- "Once you understand this principle, you'll find..."
- "This is a fundamental concept that unlocks..."
- "Let's work through this together"
- "With practice, this becomes natural"

## Narration Structure

### Opening (First Slide)
```
Welcome to this lesson on [topic]. In this lesson, we'll explore [brief overview]. 
By the end, you'll be able to [learning outcome]. Let's get started.
```

### During Lesson
- Expand on each slide's bullet points
- Explain formulas and equations in detail
- Work through examples step by step
- Provide reasoning for each step
- Reference visual materials when present: "As you can see in the diagram..."

### Closing (Final Slide)
```
To summarize: [recap main points]. The key concept here is [main takeaway]. 
In your own practice, try [suggestion if applicable]. Thank you for watching.
```

## Pacing and Flow

### Sentence Length
- Vary sentence length for natural flow
- Use shorter sentences for key points
- Longer sentences for explanations and context
- Avoid run-on sentences

### Transitions
Use smooth transitions between ideas:
- "Now let's consider..."
- "Moving on to..."
- "This brings us to..."
- "Another way to look at this is..."

### Pauses (Indicate in Script)
Mark natural pause points:
- Use `[pause]` where you should pause briefly
- After asking rhetorical questions
- After introducing a new concept
- Before revealing an answer

---

## Mathematical Language

### Numbers and Figures
- Spell out numbers one through nine
- Use numerals for 10 and above
- Use numerals in mathematical contexts: "x equals 5"
- Read decimals clearly: "3.14" as "three point one four"

### Equations and Formulas
- Read them naturally: "x squared plus y squared equals z squared"
- Explain notation: "The symbol π, which we call pi, represents..."
- Define operations: "The ÷ symbol means divide"

### Variables and Symbols
- Introduce variables clearly: "Let x represent..."
- Distinguish between letters: "Capital A" vs "lowercase a"
- Be consistent with how you refer to symbols throughout

## Examples

### ❌ Poor Narration
"Good morning everyone! Today we're gonna look at fractions. This is super easy, so let's dive in. Remember from last lesson we talked about division? Well, fractions are kinda like that."

### ✅ Good Narration
"Welcome to this lesson on fractions. A fraction represents a part of a whole, and understanding fractions is essential for many areas of mathematics. Let's start by looking at what a fraction actually means. [pause] When we write a fraction, we're showing a relationship between two numbers. Let me explain how this works."

---

### ❌ Poor Narration (Worked Example)
"So you just take 2x and add 3, then equals 7, so subtract 3 from both sides, you get 2x equals 4, divide by 2, x equals 2. Easy!"

### ✅ Good Narration (Worked Example)
"Let's solve this equation step by step. We have 2x plus 3 equals 7. [pause] Our goal is to find the value of x. First, we need to isolate the term containing x. To do this, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation. This gives us 2x equals 4. [pause] Now, to find x on its own, we divide both sides by 2. This gives us x equals 2. We can check this is correct by substituting 2 back into the original equation."

## Checklist for Every Narration

Before finalizing, ensure:
- [ ] No time-based greetings or references
- [ ] No assumptions about other lessons
- [ ] No slang or overly informal language
- [ ] No unexplained jargon
- [ ] Appropriate for adult learners
- [ ] Expands meaningfully on slide content
- [ ] Flows naturally when read aloud
- [ ] Includes clear explanations of "why" not just "how"
- [ ] Mathematical notation is clearly verbalized
- [ ] Encourages without patronizing

## Final Tips

1. **Read it aloud**: Narration should sound natural when spoken
2. **Be conversational**: Write how you'd explain to a friend, but professionally
3. **Show your working**: Explain your thought process
4. **Be precise**: Especially with mathematical terminology
5. **Stay focused**: Every sentence should serve the learning objective
